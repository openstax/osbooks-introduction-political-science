    <para id="para-00001">The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26)</term> occurred in Glasgow, Scotland, in October and November 2021. The main goal of the summit was to foster collaboration between governments, businesses, and civil society and to propel action to tackle the climate crisis.<cite target-id="rf-00001" id="cite-00001"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-00001">United Nations, “UN Climate Change Conference UK 2021,” October 2021, https://ukcop26.org/.</note></cite></para>
    <para id="para-00002">The conference was widely reported in both traditional media and nontraditional media. As discussed in Chapter 12, traditional <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">media</term> is characterized by mass communication efforts and professional journalism. The main traditional media outlets include newspapers, magazines, radio, and television. With increased use of the internet, smartphones, and social media platforms, nontraditional media has become increasingly powerful. Whereas professional journalists cover the news for traditional media outlets, nontraditional news coverage may be led by any individual with a smartphone and internet access. Nontraditional outlets, such as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">Twitter</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">Facebook</term>, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">Instagram</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">TikTok</term>, are particularly salient with specific niches of the public. That the results of the COP26 were reported on in traditional outlets like <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">CNN</term>, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">Associated Press</term>, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">BBC</term>, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">Al Jazeera</term> as well as nontraditional outlets like TikTok, Twitter, Instagram (more than 318,000 posts are tagged #cop26),<cite target-id="rf-00002" id="cite-00002"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-00002">“#cop26,” Instagram hashtag, https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/cop26/?hl=en.</note></cite> and Facebook (more than 160,000 people have posted using the hashtag #COP26) suggests that the public is concerned with the environment.<cite target-id="rf-00003" id="cite-00003"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-00003">Joseph E.

    <para id="para-00003">The COP26 summit produced an official agreement, and governments pledged to commit to adaptation, mitigation, and conservation efforts on methane, coal, transportation, and deforestation. These pledges could help the world prevent global warming from exceeding 1.5°C above preindustrial levels, a goal the majority of climate scientists involved with the COP26 consider challenging but possible.<cite target-id="rf-00004" id="cite-00004"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-00004">Jonathan Watts, “Key Cop26 Pledges Could Put World 9% Closer to 1.5C Pathway,” <emphasis effect="italics">The Guardian</emphasis>, November 11, 2021, https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/11/key-cop26-pledges-could-put-world-closer-pathway.</note></cite></para>
    <para id="para-00004">While some governments have agreed to tackle the climate crisis, others have avoided making any commitments. Governments play the “commitment vs. avoidance game” because environmental policy, like every other kind of public policy, requires costs to achieve benefits.</para>
    <para id="para-00005">For example, certain types of <term id="term-00009">environmental regulations</term>—the body of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">taxes</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">tariffs</term>, quotas, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">subsidies</term>, and regulations governments issue to promote environmental protection—increase the costs of industrial production. In a globalized economy, higher production costs make it more difficult for firms to sell their products in a competitive international market, especially if the regulations are adopted domestically but not internationally. In situations like this, a factory that cannot compete may be forced to close its doors, and if this happens, workers become unemployed<cite target-id="rf-00005" id="cite-00005"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-00005">Antoine Dechezleprêtre and Misato Sato, “The Impacts of Environmental Regulations on Competitiveness,” <emphasis effect="italics">Review of Environmental Economics and Policy</emphasis> 11, no. 2 (July 1, 2017): 183–206, https://doi.org/10.1093/reep/rex013; Timothy J. Bartik, “Social Costs of Jobs Lost Due to Environmental Regulations,” <emphasis effect="italics">Review of Environmental Economics and Policy</emphasis> 9, no. 2: 179–197 (Summer 2015), https://doi.org/10.17848/wp13-193; Eban Goodstein, <emphasis effect="italics">Jobs and the Environment: The Myth of a National Trade-Off</emphasis> (Washington, DC: Economic Policy Institute, 1994), https://files.epi.org/page/-/old/studies/jobs_environment_study_1994.pdf; Richard D.

    <para id="para-00006">On the other hand, environmental regulations promote environmental quality. If a factory emits fewer pollutants, the quality of the surrounding environment increases. The community in the factory’s vicinity reaps the benefits of less pollution. Better environmental quality contributes to improved health conditions.</para>
    <para id="para-00007">However, the causal impact of this environmental regulation in the promotion of a healthier environment is difficult to prove. The connection between the extent to which changes in pollutant emissions can improve or exacerbate the health of community members is complex. Many variables impact both environmental quality and the community’s health. To make things even more difficult, if you consider the market share of this factory in a country and compare it to the global market, the proportional environmental benefit of this environmental regulation may seem small.</para>

Environmental quality is a widespread benefit. The entire community profits from it, even if each element of the community profits only a little bit. On the other hand, unemployment is a localized cost, and unemployed workers lose a lot. As a result, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">labor unions</term>, workers, and business parties commonly refer to environmental regulations as “job-killing regulations” and thus tend to oppose them.<cite target-id="rf-00007" id="cite-00007"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-00007">Branden B.

    <para id="para-00009">Given the complexity of designing environmental policies, governments consider the redistribution of costs and benefits and play the “commitment vs. avoidance game” based on how much their <term id="term-00015">constituents</term>, or voters, stand to win or lose with environmental regulations.</para>
    <para id="para-00010">The ways in which public policies redistribute costs and benefits across domestic and international actors are at the core of the study of <term id="term-00016">international political economy (IPE)</term>. This chapter presents a panoramic view of the development of the field from the 16th century to the present. The discussion begins with a brief historical overview, which is then followed by an analysis of some of the most debated issues in the field.</para>
