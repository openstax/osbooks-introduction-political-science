    <para id="para-00002">In the 2016 US presidential election, 100 million Americans didn’t vote. A Knight Foundation study found that nonvoters have less trust in the electoral system and consume less news and information compared to voters.

    <para id="para-00011">The Voting Rights Act reflects the power that political institutions can have both to act as counteragents to racism and to promote political participation. In 1966, Congress passed the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00027">24th Amendment</term>, which abolished poll taxes. The states ratified the amendment in 1964. In 1975, Congress added language to the original Voting Rights Act requiring localities to provide multilingual voter information, and it further expanded voting rights to protect Americans with disabilities in 1982.<cite target-id="rf-00036" id="cite-00036"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-00036">“Voting Rights: A Short History,” Carnegie Corporation of New York. https://www.carnegie.org/topics/topic-articles/voting-rights/voting-rights-timeline/.</note></cite> Globally, European Union (EU) countries such as Austria, Malta, Scotland, and Wales have made voting more accessible by lowering the voter age to 16. Other institutions that can affect people’s levels of political participation include religious groups and organizations. Denison University Professor Paul <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00029">Djupe</term> and Southern Illinois University Professor J. Tobin <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00030">Grant</term> found that religious institutions can encourage political participation by recruiting members to be part of the political process and highlighting their involvement as having political consequences.<cite target-id="rf-00037" id="cite-00037"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-00037">Paul A.

    <para id="para-00012">Several factors prevent people from voting. In terms of individual-level characteristics, older voters are more likely to vote for a variety of reasons, including simply having more time to go to the polls. Those with higher incomes who are not at risk of losing their jobs or who have more flexible working hours are also more likely to vote. Race is another predictor of voter turnout, though in the 2020 election, the share of minority voters grew. Gender is yet another determinant of voter turnout, with women voting at higher rates than men. Institutional factors such as voter registration, voter ID laws, gerrymandering, and voter fatigue also affect voter turnout. Voter registration and ID requirements can affect the ease with which voters can participate in elections. Countries with automatic registration and states that register voters automatically when they get their driver’s licenses have higher rates of electoral participation. Gerrymandering, in which district lines are drawn to favor one party over another, can affect whether people show up to vote, as does voter fatigue—the idea that there are simply too many elections for people to want to take part in.</para>
