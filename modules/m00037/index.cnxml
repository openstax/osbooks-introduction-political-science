    <para id="para-00002">Persons with physical and mental disabilities are an example of a group that has experienced widespread discrimination, in part due to a lack of adequate government protections. Absent public policy forbidding it, governments have denied these individuals access to public accommodations, including access to public buildings and programs, while private businesses and other social and educational institutions have also limited opportunities for individuals with disabilities. Challenging these discriminatory policies is now a key focus among civil rights movements around the world. The <link url="https://openstax.org/r/dredf"><term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund (DREDF)</term></link> has compiled a massive list of constitutions that provide protections for those with disabilities.<cite target-id="rf-00001" id="cite-00001"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-00001">“International Laws,” Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund, https://dredf.org/legal-advocacy/international-disability-rights/international-laws/.</note></cite> This list includes the constitutions of dozens of developed and developing countries ranging from Zimbabwe and the Gambia to Cambodia and Turkey. The DREDF contains the text of Zimbabwe’s constitution, which specifically references “physical disability” as one of the protected characteristics of its citizens. In other words, the constitution clearly states that it is illegal and unconstitutional to discriminate on the basis of physical disability.</para>
    <para id="para-00003">The United States Constitution does not include any explicit protections for individuals with disabilities. Instead, the United States has sought to address disability rights through federal laws like the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">Rehabilitation Act</term> (1973), which created affirmative action in government hiring for people with disabilities,<cite target-id="rf-00002" id="cite-00002"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-00002">Shirley Wilcher, “The Rehabilitation Act of 1973: 45 Years of Activism and Progress,” <emphasis effect="italics">Insight into Diversity</emphasis>, September 17, 2018, https://www.insightintodiversity.com/the-rehabilitation-act-of-1973-45-years-of-activism-and-progress/.</note></cite> and the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">Americans with Disabilities Act</term> (1990), a landmark legislative act that made it illegal to discriminate on the basis of ability and offered sweeping changes that made it easier for people with disabilities to access services, transportation, buildings, and employment.<cite target-id="rf-00003" id="cite-00003"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-00003">US Department of Justice, “Introduction to the ADA,” https://www.ada.gov/ada_intro.htm.</note></cite> The United Kingdom, China, Australia, South Korea, New Zealand, Brazil, and Qatar have handled disability rights in a similar fashion: they have used congressional or parliamentary legislation to create national standards and provisions to protect the rights of those with disabilities.</para>

    <para id="para-00004">People with disabilities are one example of a <term id="term-00004">political minority</term>.

    <para id="para-00005">Civil rights function in society based on how the majority interacts with the minority—who gets to decide whose rights are protected, and how those protections are enforced? These determinations shape which freedoms and opportunities are reserved for the majority and which are also granted to and protected for the minority. The reality of politics is that those in the political majority use their power to secure the best outcomes for themselves. Those enjoying majority group membership often use their influence on elections to define the parameters of the majority group—who will lead, and how will they use the power they have been given?</para>

    <title>Majority and Minority Political Cultures</title>
    <para id="para-00006">As discussed in Chapter 6, each country, along with the subnational states within it, has its own unique <term id="term-00006">political culture</term>—the ways in which traditions and cultural values create that country’s specific political system. A country’s particular combination of history, geography, religious practices, conflict, and other identities contributes to creating its specific political culture. Political culture plays an important role in determining which civil rights the country protects and how well it protects them, and those with the most power are most able to influence the culture.</para>
    <para id="para-00007">Consider Qatar, a Muslim-majority, petroleum-exporting gulf monarchy known for providing the majority of its citizens with a high standard of living (but providing far less for the millions from mostly Asian and African countries who work in Qatar). Consistent with the country’s majority political culture, homosexuality is illegal in Qatar, and punishment for sodomy can range from flogging and imprisonment to death.<cite target-id="rf-00007" id="cite-00007"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-00007">Max Bearak and Darla Cameron, “Here Are the 10 Countries Where Homosexuality May Be Punished by Death,” <emphasis effect="italics">Washington Post</emphasis>, June 16, 2016, https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/06/13/here-are-the-10-countries-where-homosexuality-may-be-punished-by-death-2/.</note></cite> There are no legal protections for LGBTQ+ people. Qatar now faces the challenge of balancing its conservative political culture with its role as the 2022 host of the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">FIFA World Cup</term>, during which thousands of people with cultural values that differ from the majority values in Qatar will visit the country. The Qatari government has released statements welcoming gay fans and ensuring their safety but explicitly discouraging public displays of affection and/or having sex.<cite target-id="rf-00008" id="cite-00008"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-00008">Patrick Kelleher, “Gay Fans Are Welcome at Qatar World Cup — Just as Long as They Don’t Have Sex,” Pink News, September 27, 2019, https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2019/09/27/qatar-world-cup-2022-fifa-anti-gay-sex-homosexuality/.</note></cite></para>
    <para id="para-00008">While many of the people coming to Qatar for the World Cup will be coming from countries where the political culture is very different from the political culture in Qatar, attitudes toward LGBTQ individuals in those countries—like Germany, England, Croatia, and South Korea—were not always so tolerant. Political cultures can change, often through a combination of the work of people in nongovernment groups and movements within government institutions, and this change can affect civil rights protections.</para>

    <title>Political Culture and Civil Rights Change</title>
    <para id="para-00009">One of the biggest changes in civil rights policy in the United States came in 2015 when, in <emphasis effect="italics"><term id="term-00008">Obergefell v. Hodges</term></emphasis>, the Supreme Court struck down state laws prohibiting <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">same-sex marriage</term>. The ruling came after decades of hard work to change the political culture of the United States to one that would recognize and protect the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals. For most of American history, same-sex couples were denied the right to marry. The Supreme Court ruling that effectively secured the right to marry for same-sex couples was the culmination of over 50 years of organizing, protests, and lobbying.</para>

    <para id="para-00010">According to John <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">Kowal</term> of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School, the push to change federal denial of marriage rights to same-sex couples began in earnest during the 1996 presidential campaign in response to a court case in Hawaii where, in 1993, the state supreme court had ruled that denying same-sex couples the right to marry was in violation of the state constitution.<cite target-id="rf-00009" id="cite-00009"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-00009">John F.

    <para id="para-00011">The sharing of power between states and a national government, known as <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00011">federalism</term>, creates a unique culture that sets the United States apart from most of the world (for more on federalism, see Chapter 13: Governing Regimes). While many other countries are organized along federal lines, including Brazil, Germany, India, Mexico, and Russia, among others, only the United States Constitution includes provisions that clarify states’ rights compared to the national government (9th and 10th Amendments). Since states can create their own statutes and policies as long as they are not in conflict with the US Constitution or congressional law, each of the United States can, theoretically, enact policies that are in direct contrast with a bordering state’s policies. That each state and region of the country has a different political culture and different people in power became all too clear in the 2000s and 2010s, when most states passed their own laws on same-sex marriage, resulting in a hodge-podge of laws and policies where, for example, same-sex marriage was banned in Texas but legal in neighboring Oklahoma.<cite target-id="rf-00010" id="cite-00010"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-00010">Greg Zwiers, “LGBT Laws Differ from State to State,” <emphasis effect="italics">Iowa State Daily</emphasis>, October 17, 2014, https://www.iowastatedaily.com/news/student_life/article_e86cc4f4-5592-11e4-9ff3-2349dcd05dab.html.</note></cite></para>
    <para id="para-00012">Though the issue of sex-based discrimination and marriage rose to public prominence in Hawaii, LGBTQ+ and civil rights–related interest groups and lobbying were rippling across the country, resulting in citizen referenda, ballot propositions, legislation, and court decisions. Much of the momentum was driven by a combination of public and private advocacy work to change the national conversation on LGBTQ+ inclusion. Attitudes on the topic dovetailed generally with how people viewed homosexuality.<cite target-id="rf-00011" id="cite-00011"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-00011">“Fifty Years Since Stonewall: The Change in Public Opinion,” Roper Center for Public Opinion Research, 2019, https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/fifty-years-stonewall-change-public-opinion.</note></cite> In a 2004 national poll of Americans, less than 40 percent of respondents approved of same-sex marriage, but by 2019 that percentage had grown to more than 60 percent.<cite target-id="rf-00012" id="cite-00012"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-00012">“Attitudes on Same-Sex Marriage,” Pew Research Center, May 14, 2019, https://www.pewforum.org/fact-sheet/changing-attitudes-on-gay-marriage/.</note></cite> The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00012">AIDS</term> epidemic moved from the margins to mainstream American life during the 1980s and 1990s, and media coverage of the epidemic was partially responsible for the shift in attitudes toward homosexuality. Representation in popular culture also played a role, with popular films and television shows like <emphasis effect="italics">Philadelphia</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">Queer Eye, The L-Word</emphasis>, and <emphasis effect="italics">Will &amp; Grace</emphasis> featuring gay and lesbian characters and personalities. According to California State University professor Jeremiah <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">Garretson</term>, one major reason for the shift in acceptance of gay culture is that more Americans than ever know someone who identifies as lesbian or gay; “that increase in interpersonal contact is the major part of the reason attitude change has been so rapid,” Garretson said.<cite target-id="rf-00013" id="cite-00013"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-00013">John Wilkens, “What’s Behind the Gay Rights Attitude Shift?” <emphasis effect="italics">The San Diego Union-Tribune</emphasis>, April 4, 2015, https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-public-attitudes-gay-rights-2015apr04-story.html.</note></cite></para>
    <para id="para-00013">In November 2003, Massachusetts became the first US state to legalize same-sex marriage after the state supreme court found that prohibiting same-sex couples from being able to marry violated the state constitution.<cite target-id="rf-00014" id="cite-00014"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-00014">Kowal, “Improbable Victory.”</note></cite> In its landmark 2015 decision, the United States Supreme Court declared that “the right to marry is a fundamental right inherent in the liberty of the person . . . couples of the same-sex may not be deprived of that right and that liberty. Same-sex couples may exercise the fundamental right to marry.”<cite target-id="rf-00015" id="cite-00015"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-00015">Obergefell v.

    <para id="para-00014">The violation of a group’s civil rights demands action to ensure equal treatment. In the case of same-sex marriage in the United States, it was only after years of people engaging in activism and bringing lawsuits that public opinion and government policies changed. Wherever political minorities lack adequate representation in elected office, they must live with the decisions of the majority, which may not take into account minority concerns.</para>

For example, when the majority elects legislators who represent them, those legislators tend to enact policies that secure the majority’s status and often deny opportunities to minority group members. These policies can make it difficult for those in the minority to participate in the political process itself—for example, by voting or running for public office. In this way, the majority ensures its ongoing power.</para>

    <para id="para-00016">Political culture refers to the ways in which a country’s traditions and cultural values create that country’s specific political system. A country’s political culture, the implementation of its constitution, and power dynamics between majority and minority groups all affect civil rights. Changes in a country’s political culture can impact civil rights. Majorities have the power to either protect or discriminate against the minorities in a society. The majority can have a major influence on whether the government fulfills its obligation to affirm and protect civil rights.</para>
