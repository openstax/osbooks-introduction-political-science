To choose whom you marry? Decisions concerning what to wear, what to study in school, what career to pursue, and what religious beliefs to instill in one’s children are all privacy issues.

    <title>Freedom of Expression of Ideas</title>
    <para id="para-00038">Another area of ongoing tension between individuals and the government is the freedom of expression of ideas. This freedom includes the right to free speech and the right to the free exercise of religion. Article 19 of the UDHR states, “Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.”<footnote id="foot-00034">A/RES/217(III), art. 19.</footnote> Article 18 provides that “everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.”<footnote id="foot-00035">Ibid., art. 18.</footnote></para>
    <para id="para-00039">The UDHR is not itself legally binding, but the principles it sets out were implemented among UN member countries through the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00028">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</term> (ICCPR) and the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00029">International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights</term> (ICESCR), both of which were adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1966. Member countries agree to be monitored on their activities under the provisions of the covenants, which echo much of the language of the UDHR, although some provisions are new. Article 27 of the ICCPR, for example, states that members of “ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities . . . shall not be denied the right, in community with the other members of their group, to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practise their own religion, or to use their own language.”<footnote id="foot-00036">UN General Assembly, Resolution 2200A (XXI), International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, A/RES/2200A(XXI) (Dec. 16, 1966), art. 27, https://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CCPR.aspx.</footnote> Together, the UDHR, the ICCPR, and the ICESCR make up what is known as the International Bill of Human Rights.<footnote id="foot-00037">Leah Levin, “Human Rights and the International Community: Twenty Questions,” <emphasis effect="italics">The UNESCO Courier</emphasis>, October 1978, https://en.unesco.org/courier/october-1978/human-rights-and-international-community-twenty-questions.</footnote></para>

    <para id="para-00040">Many people who hear the term <emphasis effect="italics">civil liberties</emphasis> think about limits on government interference in individuals’ lives, and they may see government acts that limit or direct their behavior as infringements of their liberties. In these instances, it is important to remember that people live in diverse communities made up of many individuals who may have different perspectives, traditions, beliefs, and needs. Each person’s actions have the potential to affect other individuals in the community and the community as a whole. As discussed in this chapter, members of a community have responsibilities to that community. Understanding the differences between groups within a society is often referred to as <emphasis effect="italics">intercultural competence</emphasis>, and it is a key component of social responsibility.</para>
    <para id="para-00041">Different countries adopt a variety of strategies to address the varying needs of different groups. Within the United States, the corporate world has recently taken up the banner of “social responsibility.” Whether looking at an issue from a corporate position, an advocacy position (such as from the perspective of an interest group), the position of an attorney representing someone whose rights have been violated, or the position of a concerned citizen, linking the ideas of civil liberties with the larger concept of social responsibility allows one to appreciate how the rights of individuals and the larger community are intertwined and how government actions often seek to balance the freedom of the individual with the needs and desires of the community.</para>

    <para id="para-00042">However, freedom of expression and religion is not absolute. Even in countries with extensive speech protections, certain types of speech are never protected. These include libel, slander, obscenity, fighting words or threats, incitement to lawless conduct, breach of national security or classified information, disclosures that impact the right of privacy, and perjury. Some examples of these were discussed earlier in this chapter.</para>
    <para id="para-00043">In liberal democracies, the state agrees to tolerate free expression of ideas, and restrictions on expression are minimal; however, many of these countries place restrictions on the expression of specific ideas that do not meet the limited exceptions to protected speech set forth above. This is referred to as the <term id="term-00030">paradox of tolerance</term>. People who hold intolerant ideas argue that the state and society only tolerate those ideas that align with their own viewpoint and that therefore, the government and society are not tolerant of personal ideas and do not respect that degree of personal liberty.</para>

    <para id="para-00047">The paradox of tolerance is a frequent issue when it comes to religious expression. The expression of religious beliefs has received special consideration throughout history. Freedom of religion involves two interrelated issues: the free exercise of religion and the government establishment of religion. While it is impossible to separate the two completely, they can be distinguished for learning purposes.</para>
    <para id="para-00048">The US Constitution contains two separate clauses about religion: one, that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,” known as the establishment clause; and two, that Congress shall make no law “prohibiting the free exercise thereof.”<footnote id="foot-00045">U.S. Const. amend. I.</footnote> The complicated relationship between religion and the government in the United States is a subject worthy of study in itself; the following is an outline of some of the primary issues.</para>
    <Normal>In <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00032"><emphasis effect="italics">Everson v. Board of Education</emphasis></term>, a landmark case with regard to the interpretation of the establishment clause, the US Supreme Court observed that in the United States, no government should aid or hinder any religion.<footnote id="foot-00046">Everson v. Board of Education, 330 U.S. 1, 15–16 (1947).</footnote></Normal>
    <para id="para-00049">In <emphasis effect="italics">Everson</emphasis>, the court considered whether a city allowing all K–12 students to ride public transit buses for free was an unconstitutional establishment of religion because some of the students receiving free rides attended parochial schools operated by religious groups. It was argued that this amounted to an establishment of religion because, in addition to regular school classes, these students took classes in religion and were thus taught particular religious beliefs. According to this argument, the government assisted in the religious indoctrination by providing free transportation, thus putting a stamp of approval on the religious instruction. The court found that the bus rides did not violate the establishment clause because the law was neutral and beneficial for all K–12 students. If the law had only given free rides to parochial school students, it probably would have been found to violate the establishment clause, as the government would have been treating a religious institution differently and preferentially. Conversely, suppose that free rides had been denied to parochial school students and given only to students attending schools that did not teach religion. In that case, the action could be interpreted as a violation of the free exercise of religion and parental privacy in children’s education. It would violate free exercise because it would explicitly target and place restrictions on schools based on religion. This example illustrates the degree of complication in this area of the law. One must look at specific government action and ask whether it is neutral and general or explicitly benefits or intrudes on a religion.</para>
    <para id="para-00050">Not all religious practices are acceptable, even in an individualist government. For example, in the United States, religious practices that are deemed abusive to children are prohibited.<footnote id="foot-00047">One current controversy in this area is conversion therapy, or intervention by religious practitioners intended to “cure” children of LGBTQ+ sexual orientations or gender identities. See “Conversion ‘Therapy’ Laws,” Movement Advancement Project, last updated July 16, 2021, https://www.lgbtmap.org/img/maps/citations-conversion-therapy.pdf.</footnote> Those who hold views anathema to most of society, such as White supremacist churches, are allowed to operate as long as they keep the expression of their opinions nonviolent and within the church. An area of controversy arises when a person running a business refuses to comply with a customer request because it violates their personal religious views, thus putting into direct conflict the constitutional protection of the free exercise of religion and the constitutional requirement for equal treatment of all persons. The US <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00033">Civil Rights Act</term> of 1964 prohibits any business that is open to the public from engaging in discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or religion. When the Civil Rights Act went into effect, some for-profit businesses argued that it violated their personal and religious principles of White supremacy by prohibiting them from barring minorities from their business or refusing to hire employees based on their race. In the early years after the act was passed, courts across the United States upheld the act against the religious arguments for White supremacy. They found a more significant community good in supporting nondiscrimination than in this view of the free exercise of religion. Today, controversies continue, with some business owners complaining that serving LGBTQ+ customers violates their religious beliefs and that to require them to serve LGBTQ+ customers would violate their right to free exercise of religion. This controversy is ongoing in the United States and around the world.<footnote id="foot-00048">Paul J. Angelo and Dominic Bocci, “The Changing Landscape of Global LGBTQ+ Rights,” Council on Foreign Relations, January 29, 2021, https://www.cfr.org/article/changing-landscape-global-lgbtq-rights.</footnote></para>
    <para id="para-00051">In western European countries, similar issues arise. All have constitutional provisions similar to the US Constitution’s religious clauses, but some have officially recognized state religions. Anglicanism, as represented by the Church of England, is the official religion of England. Up until the 20th century, people were persecuted for not adhering to the official doctrine; however, now individuals are free to practice any religion they want as long as it complies with England’s generally applicable neutral laws.<footnote id="foot-00049">“Parliament, Church and Religion,” UK Parliament, accessed June 28, 2021, https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/private-lives/religion/overview/church-and-religion/.</footnote> Around the world, restrictions on religion have been increasing. These restrictions can take two forms: government preference for a particular religion and government restriction on religious practices. Many Islamic majority countries limit freedom of religion and require residents to adhere to an established religion. A Pew Research study noted:</para>
