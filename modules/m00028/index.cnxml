    <para id="para-00002">Despite the potential difficulty of obtaining poll results that accurately reflect the views of the people, polls remain an important component of participatory democracy.</para>
    <para id="para-00003">The Declaration of Independence, which laid the framework for American democracy, states that governments “deriv[e] their just powers from the <emphasis effect="italics">consent of the governed</emphasis>” (emphasis added). If the people’s will creates the foundation for any representative government, then public opinion polling acts as the instrument by which the people are heard and consent is granted. Elections are the people’s recourse when the government ignores their wishes. But is there evidence that <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">public opinion</term> influences government policy? Studies by several researchers, including Northwestern University Professor Benjamin I. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">Page</term> and Columbia University Professor Robert Y. <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">Shapiro</term> (1983),<cite target-id="rf-00001" id="cite-00001"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-00001">Benjamin I. Page and Robert Y. Shapiro, “Effects of Public Opinion on Policy,” American Political Science Review 77, no. 1 (March 1983): 175–190, https://www.jstor.org/stable/1956018.</note></cite> University of Washington Professor Paul <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">Burstein</term> (2003),<cite target-id="rf-00002" id="cite-00002"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-00002">Paul Burstein, “The Impact of Public Opinion on Public Policy: A Review and an Agenda,” Political Research Quarterly 56, no. 1 (March 2003): 29–40, https://www.jstor.org/stable/3219881.</note></cite> and Vanderbilt University Professor Larry <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">Bartels</term> (1991),<cite target-id="rf-00003" id="cite-00003"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-00003">Larry M.

In a <emphasis effect="italics">New York Times</emphasis> opinion piece, University of North Carolina Professor James <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">Stinson</term> writes, “When public opinion changes, demanding for example more or less government, government responds in the demanded direction. And it does so quickly.”<cite target-id="rf-00004" id="cite-00004"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-00004">James Stimson, “Don’t Underestimate the Power of Public Opinion,” New York Times, updated April 22, 2014, https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/04/21/do-the-rich-call-the-shots-13/dont-underestimate-the-power-of-public-opinion.</note></cite> One need not look far to see the simple relationship between public opinion and policy outcomes: President Barack <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">Obama</term> was elected by a public that overwhelmingly agreed that the economy, jobs, and health care were their top priorities.<cite target-id="rf-00005" id="cite-00005"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-00005">Pew Research Center, For Voters It’s Still the Economy (Washington, DC: Pew Research Center, September 2012), https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2012/09/24/for-voters-its-still-the-economy/.</note></cite> As such, his policy agenda reflected these concerns. At the top of his list was an economic stimulus package and, of course, the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">Affordable Care Act</term>. In a way, we can understand public opinion and its influence on policy as a chicken-and-egg relationship: the public alerts elected officials of their preferences, and these officials then try to sell their solutions to the public as the best course of action. This relationship further underscores the importance of public opinion in our democratic process. Polls allow voters to assess choices and, in the most idealistic sense, provoke people to think about issues and alternatives. In this way, the very acts of polling and being polled are also important parts of the democratic process and encourage people to become informed and aware.</para>
    <para id="para-00004">Public opinion also plays a crucial role in our globalized world. In an interview with the Council on Foreign Relations, political psychologist Steven <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">Kull</term> of <link url="https://openstax.org/r/worldpublicopinion">WorldPublicOpinion.org</link> explained, “If policy practitioners want to promote international cooperation, they can pretty much see public opinion as a kind of ally in this process—not in every case, of course, but this is a tendency on that side.”<cite target-id="rf-00006" id="cite-00006"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-00006">Steven Kull, Stewart M. Patrick, and Marvin Kalb, “Does Public Opinion Matter? World Attitudes on Global Governance,” Council on Foreign Relations, December 4, 2009, https://www.cfr.org/event/does-public-opinion-matter-world-attitudes-global-governance-0.</note></cite> In simpler terms, another reason it is important for Americans to understand global public opinion is that it gives us the ability to view the world and ourselves from a different perspective.</para>

    <para id="para-00005">For example, the graph in <link target-id="fig-00001" document="m00028"/> illustrates how Britain, France, and Germany viewed recent US presidents in fall 2020 and how much confidence they had in the incoming Biden administration. Understanding how people in other countries view the United States is important “because popular sentiments and resentments constrain what a government (even in a not-particularly-democratic nation) can do.”<cite target-id="rf-00007" id="cite-00007"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-00007">Paul R. Pillar, “American Politicians Should Care More about Global Public Opinion,” Atlantic, January 7, 2012, https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/01/american-politicians-should-care-more-about-global-public-opinion/251013/.</note></cite> In this way, understanding public sentiment is not only important <emphasis effect="italics">within</emphasis> countries; it is vital when working across nations. Public opinion is crucial for elected officials to gauge public sentiment and understand how to engage in diplomacy because “US leaders’ credibility in the eyes of foreign publics is critical in shaping attitudes toward US foreign policy.”<cite target-id="rf-00008" id="cite-00008"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-00008">Benjamin E. Goldsmith and Yusaku Horiuchi, “Spinning the Globe? US Public Diplomacy and Foreign Public Opinion,” Journal of Politics 71, no. 3 (July 2009): 1.</note></cite> Public opinion is thus vital for understanding not only how the public views its own government but also how the US government engages with other countries.</para>
    <para id="para-00006">If <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">public opinion</term> works to legitimize governments, and if we are reliant on sound polling practices in order to gauge public sentiment, we must care about the future of public opinion polling as an industry. As an article in <emphasis effect="italics">Atlantic</emphasis> points out, “Public-opinion polling was one of the last ways we had to understand what other Americans actually believe. If polling doesn’t work, then we are flying blind.”<cite target-id="rf-00009" id="cite-00009"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-00009">David A. Graham, “The Polling Crisis Is a Catastrophe for American Democracy,” Atlantic, November 4, 2020, https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/11/polling-catastrophe/616986/.</note></cite></para>
    <para id="para-00007">Despite the inherent and explicit importance of public opinion, the practice and science of polling faces new challenges. In the 2016 presidential election, an overwhelming number of pollsters inaccurately predicted that Hillary <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00013">Clinton</term> would win the presidency over Donald <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00014">Trump</term>. Again in 2020, the polls overstated the margin by which Joe <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00015">Biden</term> would take the White House. If polling is subject to scientific rigor, how did this happen? Some attributed the inaccuracy of the polls to an underweighting of voters without college degrees, who turned out in great numbers to propel Donald Trump to the presidency, and an overexuberance of Biden supporters to respond to polls, respectively. Other explanations included the fact that large swaths of undecided voters did not decide on their vote until the last minute, particularly in 2016.<cite target-id="rf-00010" id="cite-00010"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-00010">Nate Cohn, “What Went Wrong with Polling? Some Early Theories,” New York Times, November 10, 2020, https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/upshot/polls-what-went-wrong.html.</note></cite> Accuracy in polling is increasingly hampered by modern-day facts, including the decreasing likelihoods that people will own a landline, be at home during the day to answer pollsters, or respond to polls in general due to lowering levels of public trust. Another suggestion is that those people who actually respond to polls are not representative of the population in general and that their responses skew the accuracy of polls in a way that has yet to be addressed through advanced polling techniques.<cite target-id="rf-00011" id="cite-00011"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-00011">Dylan Matthews, “One Pollster’s Explanation for Why the Polls Got It Wrong,” Vox, Vox Media, November 10, 2020, https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/11/10/21551766/election-polls-results-wrong-david-shor.</note></cite> Despite these rational explanations, the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections show that while both state and national polls face challenges in portraying public sentiment accurately, the importance of valid opinion polls is self-evident. As Vanderbilt University Professor Joshua <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00016">Clinton</term> explains, while elections can tell us who wins, polls are the best tools available to tell us <emphasis effect="italics">why</emphasis>, underscoring yet another facet of the importance of polls—their explanatory power.<cite target-id="rf-00012" id="cite-00012"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-00012">Joshua Clinton, “Polling Problems and Why We Should Still Trust (Some) Polls,” The Vanderbilt Project on Unity and American Democracy, Vanderbilt University, January 11, 2021, https://www.vanderbilt.edu/unity/2021/01/11/polling-problems-and-why-we-should-still-trust-some-polls/.</note></cite></para>
    <para id="para-00018">While reaching the electorate has undoubtedly become more difficult, the importance of polling within a democracy remains. Sam <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00017">Wang</term>, neuroscience Professor at Princeton University and cofounder of the blog <link url="https://openstax.org/r/princeton-election">Princeton Election Consortium</link>, explains that “polling is critically important because it is a way by which we can measure public sentiment more rigorously than any other method.”<cite target-id="rf-00013" id="cite-00013"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-00013">Sam Wang, “Why Polls Were Mostly Wrong,” interview by Gloria Dickie, Scientific American, November 13, 2020, https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-polls-were-mostly-wrong/.</note></cite> As the industry continues to reflect and evolve in response to changes in technology and the electorate, it is important for us to remember the value of polls, understand how they are conducted, and participate fully and honestly when called upon to do so. Editor-in-chief of the Gallup Poll Frank <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00018">Newport</term> provides a succinct explanation for the importance of public opinion polling: “Humans live with and around other people. Acquiring a knowledge of these people is an important way in which humans manage to survive, get along, and come together to accomplish common goals.”<cite target-id="rf-00014" id="cite-00014"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-00014">Frank Newport, Polling Matters: Why Leaders Must Listen to the Wisdom of the People (New York: Warner Books, 2004), 1–2.</note></cite></para>

    <para id="para-00008">Public opinion is important because it is the mechanism by which the public alerts elected officials of their preferences. Elected officials also rely on swaying public opinion in order to sell a legislative agenda to the public as the best course of action. In addition, understanding public opinion across countries allows for global cooperation and partnership.</para>
