    <para id="para-00001">In 2021, Venezuela was a country in crisis. According to the <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">Human Rights Watch</term>, millions of Venezuelans lacked adequate nutrition. The absence of accessible health care and safe drinking water contributed to the spread of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">COVID-19</term>. The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00003">UN Human Rights Council</term> cited Venezuelan president Nicolás <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">Maduro</term>’s administration for crimes against humanity, including extrajudicial executions, police brutality, and torture. The crisis led an estimated 5.5 million Venezuelans—more than 15 percent of Venezuela’s total population—to flee the country.<cite target-id="rf-00001" id="cite-00001"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-00001">“Venezuela,” in <emphasis effect="italics">World Report 2021: Events of 2020</emphasis> (New York: Human Rights Watch, 2021), https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2021/country-chapters/venezuela; “Venezuela,” in <emphasis effect="italics">World Report 2022: Events of 2021</emphasis> (New York: Human Rights Watch, 2022), https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2022/country-chapters/venezuela.</note></cite></para>
    <para id="para-00002">Venezuela’s troubles stem from decades of efforts to make the most of the country’s economy. These efforts have been couched in differing <term id="term-00005">political ideologies</term>—that is, consciously held ideas about both how political life is structured and how it <emphasis effect="italics">should</emphasis> be structured. Venezuela is rich in oil reserves. In 1913, the Venezuelan government contracted with the Royal Dutch Shell Group to extract those reserves. By the 1950s, Venezuela was a leading oil exporter, and its <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00006">gross national income</term>—the total value of the goods and services in its economy—was the highest in Latin America.<cite target-id="rf-00002" id="cite-00002"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="rf-00002">Callum Brodie, “Venezuela Was Once South America’s Richest Country.

In 1998, Hugo <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00007">Chávez</term> was elected president of Venezuela on a platform rooted in socialist ideology, which he promised would improve the condition of the lower classes. Chávez placed the oil industry under the control of the state and embarked on a program of significant wealth redistribution. Chávez’s successor, Nicolás Maduro, has kept these policies in place.

Defenders of the Maduro regime argue that sanctions imposed by nations hostile to Venezuela’s socialist ideology have been the major driver of economic decline and that human rights abuses have been exaggerated. Opponents of the regime, both inside and outside Venezuela, allege that the problems—both economic and political—result from socialist ideology itself. Will opponents of the socialist regime emerge triumphant? If so, will the political ideologies of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">liberalism</term> and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">neoliberalism</term> espoused in opposition to Chávez and Maduro eventually prevail? The future of Venezuela remains uncertain.</para>
    <para id="para-00003">So far, the 21st century has been marked by increasing tensions among rival political ideologies around the world.

In many parts of the world, ideological flux defines political life, with contests between and among socialism, liberalism and neoliberalism, the center left, conservative populism, religious extremism, and a range of other ideological visions.</para>

This chapter begins with a brief review of some of the core thinkers and central concepts in Western political thought that developed from the classical period of the fifth and fourth centuries BCE to the present.</para>
