     <contenttitle>Challenging an Incumbent</contenttitle>
      <contentdata>
      <para><a target="_blank" href="https://www.opensecrets.org/">OpenSecrets.org</a>, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that tracks money in politics and its effects on elections, reports that the likelihood of an incumbent winning reelection to the House is over 90&#37;. </para>
      <para>How did then 29-year-old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez beat a 10-term congressman and Democratic Caucus chair to become the youngest-ever female member of the United States Congress?</para>
      <para>This study looks at how a progressive political movement, demographics, and a strategic media campaign helped Ocasio-Cortez win a unique and unprecedented election.</para>

      <contenttitle>The Backdrop</contenttitle>
      <contentdata>
        <para>Donald J. Trump was elected president of the United States in 2016, beating Hillary Rodham Clinton in the final electoral college vote. During the Democratic primary, when it became clear that Vermont senator Bernie Sanders would not be able to beat Clinton and move on to the general election, a group of Sanders’s former staffers created a political action committee (PAC) called Brand New Congress with the intent of recruiting underrepresented minorities and progressives to run for the House and Senate.</para>

      <contenttitle>The Reality</contenttitle>
      <contentdata>
        <para>Ocasio-Cortez needed to beat long odds. To help pay off her mother's home and her own college debt, she took a job as a bartender and then worked for a nonprofit. After she worked as an organizer for the Sanders campaign, her brother nominated her to be one of the candidates that Brand New Congress would support.</para>
        <para>When Ocasio-Cortez announced her candidacy, it was for New York's 14th Congressional District—a seat held by 10-term (20-year) congressman Joseph Crowley (pictured). Crowley was the Democratic Caucus chair, the fourth most powerful Democrat in the House. Ocasio-Cortez had to challenge him in the primary election before she could get on the ballot for the general election.</para>

      <contenttitle>The Path Forward</contenttitle>
      <contentdata>
        <para>How would a minority woman with no elected political experience unseat a powerful congressman who'd held his seat for 20 years?</para>
         <para>Ocasio-Cortez's campaign highlighted Crowley's position as head of the local Democratic Party machine and chair of the Democratic Caucus as evidence that he was an establishment politician who could not understand the concerns of his constituents. </para>
          <para>Sensing a swell of progressive support in the district, Ocasio-Cortez ran on a platform of paid family leave, Medicare for all, and criminal justice reform, calculating that the 14th Congressional District would support her as it had supported Sanders in the Democratic presidential primary two years prior.</para>

      <contenttitle>Working the Demographics</contenttitle>
      <contentdata>
        <para>Some assumed Crowley would easily win reelection. Yet Ocasio-Cortez, whose mother is from Puerto Rico, saw an opporunity to capture support from young voters and Latina/Latino voters. </para>
         <para>When Crowley won the district in 1999, it was only 28&#37; Hispanic. By the time Ocasio-Cortez won, 50&#37; of district residents were Hispanic, and 45&#37; were under 35. Her progressive platform resonated with these populations, and she received endorsements from progressive groups such as the Democratic Socialists of America, MoveOn, and Democracy for America. Notably, she rejected money from PACs and corporations.</para>

      <contenttitle>Social Media</contenttitle>
      <contentdata>
        <para>Ocasio-Cortez had a leg up on Crowley on social media. Even before the start of the campaign, she had more Twitter followers—a reflection, perhaps, of both her age and her dexterity in using technology to reach younger people.</para>
        <para>Her initial campaign ad, "The Courage to Change," showed her on a subway platform, changing from sneakers into heels like any other Queens commuter, and implied that her primary opponent was out of touch. The ad went viral on YouTube and Twitter, receiving 300,000 views in a single day. It was produced by a media production company that works for socialist causes, lending legitimacy to the ad and to Ocasio-Cortez as a dedicated progressive candidate.</para>

      <contenttitle>The Media</contenttitle>
      <contentdata>
        <para>Ocasio-Cortez's media strategy was part and parcel of her ultimate success: she courted left-leaning media sites such as the Intercept and drew attention from local news, but she stayed under the radar of the traditional media. Some noted that her campaign benefited from the "Cinderella story" angle and that the media loved playing her up as the underdog.</para>
          <para>She also utilized YouTube, granting interviews to channels such as the Young Turks, an alternative news show on the online platform. She allowed a childhood friend and freelance photographer to document her campaign, and her campaign used those photographs online and released them to media outlets. </para>

      <contenttitle>The Win</contenttitle>
      <contentdata>
        <para>The primary election was held on June 26, 2018. After the votes were tallied, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had won by a substantial margin, with 57&#37; of the vote. The last time Joe Crowley had faced a primary challenger for his seat was in 2004, when Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was 15—not even old enough to vote. Crowley had been one of the most powerful Democrats in the House and was long considered a natural successor to Nancy Pelosi for the position of Speaker of the House. With the loss, he was left to find a new job. Ocasio-Cortez went on to win the general election and capture the seat.</para>

      <contenttitle>The Future</contenttitle>
      <contentdata>
     
       <para>After her historic election, Ocasio-Cortez was hailed as the future of the US Democratic Party and a leader of a new progressive movement in American politics. In her second term, she serves on the high-profile Oversight and Reform and Financial Services committees.</para>
        
         <para>In 2020, in the second-most expensive House election in American history, Ocasio-Cortez won reelection by over 40 percentage points.  When she took the House seat in 2018, she showed that it is possible to beat an incumbent. The question for the future is how she will manage her own incumbency while maintaining her progressive roots.</para>
